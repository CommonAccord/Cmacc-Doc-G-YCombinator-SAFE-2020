In making the conversion from the original Word documents to the PrOb format - a few notes:

The original Word document for Cap-NoDiscount does not use even the most basic outining of Word.  Outline items are done as indents and hand-typed numbers.  This is bad practice in general (unless the point is to make modification harder - hmm, maybe that is the reason).  It makes the process of conversion a little bit more work. 

LawyersNote=In the Cap-NoDiscount, "Post-Money Valuation Cap" is used, and in one place is "quoted", but not defined.  "Discount Rate" is "quoted" but not defined.  The meanings seem unambiguous, but the form seems slightly informal/inconsistent.
